    "chestPain": "Select the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual: caused when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood",
    "restingBloodPressure": "Blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit): may be high due to obesity, high cholesterol or diabetes",
    "serumCholestoral": "Serum cholesterol in mg/dl (unit): A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol",
    "fastingBloodSugar": "Compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. Not producing enough of a hormone secreted by your pancreas (insulin)",
    "restingECG": "Resting electrocardiographic results. For people at low risk of cardiovascular disease, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the potential harms of screening with resting or exercise ECG equal or exceed the potential benefits. For people at intermediate to high risk, current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening",
    "maxHeartRateAchieved": "The increase in cardiovascular risk, associated with the acceleration of heart rate, was comparable to the increase in risk observed with high blood pressure. It has been shown that an increase in heart rate by 10 beats per minute was associated with an increase in the risk of cardiac death by at least 20%, and this increase in the risk is similar to the one observed with an increase in systolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg",
    "exerciseInducedAngina": "The pain or discomfort associated with angina usually feels tight, gripping or squeezing, and can vary from mild to severe. Angina is usually felt in the center of your chest but may spread to either or both of your shoulders, or your back, neck, jaw or arm. It can even be felt in your hands. o Types of Angina a. Stable Angina / Angina Pectoris b. Unstable Angina c. Variant (Prinzmetal) Angina d. Microvascular Angina",
    "stDepressionInducedByExercise": "A treadmill ECG stress test is considered abnormal when there is a horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm at 60–80 ms after the J point. Exercise ECGs with up-sloping ST-segment depressions are typically reported as an ‘equivocal’ test. In general, the occurrence of horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment depression at a lower workload (calculated in METs) or heart rate indicates a worse prognosis and higher likelihood of multi-vessel disease. The duration of ST-segment depression is also important, as prolonged recovery after peak stress is consistent with a positive treadmill ECG stress test. Another finding that is highly indicative of significant CAD is the occurrence of ST-segment elevation > 1 mm (often suggesting transmural ischemia); these patients are frequently referred urgently for coronary angiography",
    "peakExerciseSTSegment": "A treadmill ECG stress test is considered abnormal when there is a horizontal or down-sloping ST-segment depression â‰¥ 1 mm at 60â€“80 ms after the J point.",
    "numberOfMajorVesselsColoredByFlourosopy": "The Major Blood Vessels are the ascending aorta, the pulmonary trunk, the pulmonary veins, the superior vena cava, and the inferior vena cava. The aorta is the most important artery of the systemic circulation measured as Slopes",
    "thalassemia": "Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by less oxygen-carrying protein (haemoglobin) and fewer red blood cells in the body than normal"
